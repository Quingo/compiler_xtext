# Quingo Prototype Compiler

This repository is a prototype compiler built with [XText](https://eclipse.org/Xtext/) for the [Quingo]() language. It builds three tools:
- A command-line compiler (executable jar);
- An LSP server, which can be used in a VS Code extension;
- An Eclipse plug-in.

## Build Instruction
See [build_instruction.md](docs/build_instruction.md). [file_structure.md](docs/file_structure.md) has listed some important source files.
